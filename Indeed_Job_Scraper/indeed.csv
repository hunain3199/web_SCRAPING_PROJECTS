We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Jest and React Testing Library. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using CSS modules and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC. We house our design system in Storybook.\n\nWe care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code.
